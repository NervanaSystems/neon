    #                   gradient checks specific to recurrent networks.

    #                state is reset back to zero

    #             number of time unrolling steps (boolean)
    # unrolls - number of time unrolling steps
    # make_plots - RNN specific plots that show weight matrices and track

    #              be no larger than the size of the training dataset.
