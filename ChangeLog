* Merge branch 'rnn-docs' into 'master' [Scott Leishman]

  Rnn docs

  Added doc-strings describing the dataset format expected for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

  See merge request !7

* Fix section headings, other typos. [Scott Leishman]

  Also fix minor doc path issue to ensure docstrings are parsed from local
  build area.

* Updated documentation for recurrent networks and datasets. [Urs Koster]

* Merge branch 'bn-compound2' into 'master' [Scott Leishman]

  Bn compound2

  Added gpu backend calls for fprop and bprop pass of Batch Normalization, which results in a 10% overall speedup on Alexnet. Also deletes minibatch provider at the end of training to free up device DDR for inference.

  See merge request !6

* Removed extraneous RNN train_mode false call. [Scott Leishman]

* Delete minibatch provider after training to save memory. [Urs Koster]

* Added gpu backend calls for fprop and bprop pass of Batch Normalization, which results in a 10% overall. [Urs Koster]

* Merge branch 'noyaml' into 'master' [Scott Leishman]

  Noyaml

  Add example code to create networks without .yaml.

  See merge request !4

* Added noyaml example to docs. [Scott Leishman]

* Merge branch 'master' into noyaml. [Scott Leishman]

* Merge branch 'IntegrationTest' into 'master' [Scott Leishman]

  Added Integration tests

  * Added integration tests based on our current example networks and backends.
    * Requires Maxwell GPU with nervanagpu and cudanet backends installed, as well as imagenet dataset.
    * New command line parameter `--integration` that cleans up YAML files to make them more easily
      reproducible.
    * Currently requires manual inspection of results relative to prior runs on the same machine to
      determine if outputs are feasible.
  * Added tolerances to the serialization tests.

  See merge request !2

* Allow CL params for outfile and logfile to integration tests. [Scott Leishman]

* Serialize Makefile cleanup. [Scott Leishman]

* Merge branch 'master' into IntegrationTest. [Scott Leishman]

* Merge pull request #20 from Kaixhin/change_cuda_check. [Scott Leishman]

  Change GPU check to CUDA SDK check. Closes issue #19

* Change GPU check to CUDA SDK check. Closes issue #19. [Kaixhin]

* Cleanup prior integration approach files. [Scott Leishman]

* Ensure integration tests run from all directories. [Scott Leishman]

* Swap branch with non-branch yaml again. [Alex Park]

* Allow reuse of example yamls for integration testing - Add integration command line option to neon executable - Adjust yaml options in integration mode - Among other things, drop serialization path, remove sources of randomization - Add is_random attribute to layers to identify drop-able layers   (Just dropout for now) - Make dotransforms have the correct behavior in Imageset - Change batch norm warnings to static to avoid proliferation of messages across many layers - Switch branch and small layers for cifar mlp since they were incorrectly labeled - Create integration test script in examples directory that uses existing metrics code - Correct i1k-alexnet-fp16 to use fp16 as backend data type. [Alex Park]

* Added checks for nervanagpu and cudanet in dev tests. [Arjun Bansal]

* Style fixes. [Arjun Bansal]

* Deleted commented layers in tests yamls. [Arjun Bansal]

* Moved test yamls to a separate subdirectory. [Arjun Bansal]

* Deleted the cpu/gpu command line parameters for serialize and integration since they aren't used right now. [Arjun Bansal]

* Added tolerances for serialization tests. [Arjun Bansal]

* Added integration tests. [Arjun Bansal]

* Add example code to create networks without .yaml. [Anil Thomas]

  It is possible to create and use networks without using a .yaml file.
  This is illustrated by examples/mlp/mnist-small-noyaml.py.

* Simplify the expression for computing output dims. [Anil Thomas]

  This is for computing dimensions of an output feature map in a
  convolutional or pooling layer.

* Let datasets have access to the experiment object. [Anil Thomas]

  Custom plug-ins may use this functionality instead of defining own
  experiment classes.

* Documentation link updates. [Scott Leishman]

* Merge pull request #13 from kellyp/master. [Scott Leishman]

  Update readme with correct using neon link

* Update readme with correct using neon link. [Kelly Plummer]

* Fix broken links in docs, remove i1K. [Scott Leishman]

* Convnet/i1k-alexnet-fp16.yaml was using float32 &amp; mb=64. fixed. [Arjun Bansal]

* Change the value of the sumWidth parameter. [Anil Thomas]

  This parameter affects the performance of the weight gradient computation
  in the cudanet backend.

* Fix computation of the number of samples. [Anil Thomas]

  This issue was causing neon to compute the number of samples
  incorrectly when &quot;predictions&quot; is specified in the .yaml file
  and the number of samples in the validation set is different
  from that in the training set.


## v0.8.1 (2015-05-04)

### Modifications

* Initial public release of neon. [Scott Leishman]
